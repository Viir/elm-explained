# Elm explained

Some demonstration code and commentary
to explain various fundamental features of the Elm language.
The idea is mainly just to be able to read and understand Elm code,
not so much how to use it well.

Types:
* [Type aliases](types/TypeAliases.md)
* [Type constructors](types/TypeConstructors.md)
* [Parameterised types](types/ParameterisedTypes.md)
* [Union types](types/UnionTypes.md)
* [Record types](types/RecordTypes.md)
* [Extensible record types](types/ExtensibleRecordTypes.md)
* [Outstanding questions about types](types/TypeQuestions.md)

Functions:
* [Different ways of defining functions](DefiningFunctions.elm)
* [Different ways of applying functions](ApplyingFunctions.elm)
